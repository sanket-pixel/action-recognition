## 1. Action Recognition using Temporal Segment Network (TSN)
In action recognition, there are two critical and complementary notions : visual conetext and temporal context. Not only does an action recognition model needs to understand what is seen in a frame, but it also needs to model how are scenes changing in a across frames. To that end, two major challenges arise while modeling action recognition . First, long range temporal structure and second the volume of training data needed to get a good fit. Most models only model short term motions and require large amount of training data , which is not readily available in the case of videos. Temporal Segment Networks aims to addresses these two issues in action recognition.

Temporal Segment Networks (TSN) uses a two stream architecture where one stream models on RGB data to understand visual context in a video, while another stream models using optical flow to perceive the temporal dynamics across the frames. To tackle the problem of long term temporal modeling, TSN divides each training sample videos into segments. Thereafter, it randomly selects snippets from each segment and trains a model for each segment parallely. Each segment is forward passed through a Convolution Neural Network ( CNN ) model ( Resnet18 in this project ) and the output predictions from each such segment is then averaged out to give a single predcition. Intuitively, the network models activities across the entire video by averaging predicitons across multiple segments. This same process is repeated for both RGB based model and Optical Flow Based model. And finally while testing, late fusion is applied by averaging the predictions from RGB and Optical Flow.
